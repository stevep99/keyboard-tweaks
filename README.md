Ideas and scripts for optimizing your keyboard.

This project contains [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/ "AutoHotkey") scripts and [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-GB/goglobal/bb964665.aspx "Keyboard Layout Creator") (KLC) files for making your typing experience more comfortable and efficient.

## AutoHotkey scripts

[AltGr scripts](AltGr/ "AltGr scripts")
- AltGr Progammer extension - making available commonly needed programmer keys such as brackets and symbols available in convenient locations.
- AltGr International extension - making a variety of accented characters, currency, mathematical and other symbols all available via the AltGr key.

[Extend layer scripts](ExtendLayer/ "Extend layer scripts]")
- Re-use a modifier key (e.g. CapsLock) for something much more useful. This script provides a navigation layer via holding a chosen modifier key and pressing other keys. Includes arrow keys, home, end, page up/down and more. If using the CapsLock key, the actual CapsLock function is still available via a mapping.

[Misc scripts](Misc/ "Misc scripts]")
- Other miscellaneous AutoHotkey scripts: sticky shift, numeric keypad layer.

To try out any of the scripts, install the excellent [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/ "AutoHotkey") and then run the script. Or choose "Edit This Script" from the AutoHotkey menu and paste in the script you want to try.

## KLC Wide Layouts

[KLC Wide Layouts](KLC/ "KLC Wide Layouts")
- Adopt a more comfortable typing posture by keeping a greater separation between your hands.
- Easier access to keys on the right-hand side, e.g. Return, Backspace, Right Shift.
- Currently available for UK Qwerty and UK Colemak keyboards, modifiable for other layouts.

To try out these layouts, a Windows installer is available in the zip package. Alternatevely, if you have Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator installed, you can load in the KLC source file and make custom changes.
